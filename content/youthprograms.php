<p><img src="images/youth/VARSITY.jpg" width="475" /></p>
<p>This is a time for High School students to get together and unwind in the youth room as we talk about God and life. We meet Sunday nights from 7:00-8:30.</p>
<p><strong>Service Opportunities<br />
</strong>We offer many opportunities for students to serve those in need, from local service projects like clothing drives and soup kitchens to missions trips in other parts of the country.</p>
<p><strong>Retreats<br />
</strong>We understand that students have busy lives with academics, sports, clubs etc. and we offer them a chance to get away from the daily stresses. Whether itâ€™s a weekend in the fall or a longer trip during vacation we encourage students to join us as we get away and relax.</p>
<p><strong>Confirmation Class</strong></p>

<p>This 10-week confirmation class is open to those in 8th and 9th grades for the purposes of deepening their Biblical understanding and preparing them for church membership. The class begins in the fall and meets on scheduled Sundays. This is an important class for young people for their faith development and spiritual growth. The students will have an opportunity to meet with the members of the Session prior to the Confirmation date, which is traditionally on Palm Sunday.  Contact the church office if you are interested in the next class.</p>
