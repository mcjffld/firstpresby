<p>Welcome to a church which exists to worship, know and serve God -- and in such a way that individual lives are transformed, our neighborhood and even our region are strengthened! We believe that when people of all ages and of many different faith backgrounds are brought together with the life-transforming grace of God in Jesus Christ, a healing work is done, in their lives as well as the lives of others. When people are given grace-filled avenues to study and serve, their lives are freed from fear and even from self-centeredness. Others are blessed. We make a difference!</p>
<p>We invite you to join us in worship or in any of the small groups which are being formed all the time for study and mission. You will find a friendly, caring church family.</p>
<p>Edward F. Duffy, Pastor</p>
