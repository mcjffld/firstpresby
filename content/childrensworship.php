<p>During Sunday Worship, children worship with their parents at the beginning of the service and are then invited to the front of the Sanctuary for Children's Time. This time is designed to help our young ones better understand their relationship with God. They are then dismissed to their Small Groups (middle and high school students are encouraged to participate in the worship service with their parents).</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Infants to Age 2 - Go to the Crib/Toddler Room on the 1st floor of the Christian Ed. Wing<br />
    Ages 3 and 4 - Go to the Yellow Room on the 1st Floor of the Christian Ed. Wing<br />
    Ages 4 through Grade 5 - Go to the classrooms on the 2nd Floor of the Christian Ed. Wing </p>
</blockquote>
<p>For the convenience and support of our families with young children, the Reading Room is a perfect place for toddlers to enjoy a quiet activity, such as a book or puzzle, while their parent listens to the service via speaker. The Reading Room is located off the hallway near the main entrance to the sanctuary, between the Narthex and Brooks Hall. </p>
