<h2><a name="habitat" target="_parent"></a>Habitat for Humanity of Coastal Fairfield County</h2>
<p>Many of our members play active roles with Habitat for Humanity of Coastal Fairfield County, which has built homes for over 100 Bridgeport families. We organized the Presbyterian Coalition with six other Presbyterian Churches to sponsor and build homes for two families. Volunteer workers from First Presby work at Habitat the last two Saturdays of each month. Working together is a great way to get to know each other on a deeper level. Come join in the fun! <a href="#top" target="_parent">back to top</a></p>

<h2><a name="operationhope" target="_parent"></a>Operation Hope</h2>
<p>Every second Saturday of the month, our church members prepare meals for Operation Hope of Fairfield. This program provides a well-balanced hot meal for residents of the Operation Hope shelter. We cook for roughly 45 people using the commercial style kitchen at our church.

Periodically we meet with clients of the Bridgeport Rescue Mission for socialization and enrichment.</p>

<h2><a name="projectlearn" target="_parent"></a>Project Learn Program of the Council of Churches of Greater Bridgeport</h2>
<p>We provide school supplies and support to the Project Learn Program. In 1969, The Council of Churches started a homework help program at a public housing project, currently known as Trumbull Gardens. To this day Project Learn opens the doors of inner-city Bridgeport community centers and churches after school Monday through Friday during the academic year. The focus of the program is encouraging, educating and enriching the lives of the enrolled children.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>THE ANGEL TREE </strong></p>
  <p>We will be collecting gift items for 30 children in the Project Learn after-school program.</p>
  <p>The Angel Tree will be by the office during the week and in Brooks Hall on Sundays.  Stars on the Tree will give each child’s name, age, sex, the gift he/she would like and the store where you can find the item.  There are several ways to help:</p>
  <p> - Take one or more stars and bring that child’s present to a special basket in the office by Monday, December 15.  Please attach the star to the present so that we know who is to get your gift.<br />
    - You may choose to contribute any amount that you feel comfortable with; we will then pool all contributions together and buy any missing gifts.<br />
    - Yet another way of participation is to donate batteries A, AA, AAA. A lot of these toys require batteries that most of the times are not included.<br />
    - And remember: These gifts will be picked up on Monday December 15.<br />
