<p>The goal of the youth ministry at First Presbyterian Church of Fairfield is to see middle school and high school students mature into the people God has made them to be. The ministry is designed to encourage and empower students and their families in a way that is relevant to them and the world in which they live. The four primary values of the ministry come from Jesus' example as seen in the Gospels: relationships, worship, outreach and service.

<p><strong>Relationships<br />
</strong>The leaders of the youth ministry love to spend time hanging out with teenagers. It shows them that we genuinely care for them, and it builds trust and communication between the youth leaders and the teens. Jesus did the same thing with his disciples as he shared meals, met them at work, traveled and lived his life alongside them.</p>
<p><strong>Worship</strong><br />
Worship is acknowledging Jesus as king in all we do. The youth ministry gives teenagers the opportunity to worship Jesus through the study of scripture, prayer and fellowship. Our desire is to see students engaged with God through meaningful and relevant worship.</p>
<p><strong>Outreach</strong><br />
Throughout scripture Jesus encourages his followers to share their faith and hope with the rest of the world. Our youth ministry welcomes Christians and non-Christians alike. We want to be an integral part of the community in Fairfield County.</p>
<p><strong>Service</strong><br />
Todayâ€™s teenagers are becoming increasingly aware of the many problems that exist in our world. Jesus put great emphasis in caring for those in need. The youth ministry gives teenagers the opportunity to get involved in meeting the needs of the world they live in.</p>
