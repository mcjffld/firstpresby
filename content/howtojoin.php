<h1>Visitors &amp; Membership</h1>
<p>Visitors and non-member friends of the church are welcome to attend and participate in the worship services and programs of the church as often and as long as they wish. For most, however, there comes a time when he/she wishes to make the commitment to become a full member of the church, and to do so is a relatively easy process. </p>
<p>Depending on existing church affiliation and previous experience, a person can become a member of our church by the following means: </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Confession of Faith and Baptism (if the Sacrament of Baptism has not been received previously)<br />
    Transfer of Membership<br />
    Reaffirmation of Faith </p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you have been visiting with us and are considering membership, the first step is to speak with Rev. Duffy or the Elder who stands in the back of the church each Sunday after church. You will know when the time is right for you to officially join our church family. In the meantime, please be assured that you are always welcome to participate in all parts of our worship, attend our programs, enjoy fellowship and share in Godâ€™s community of faith. </p>
<p>We welcome you to join our congregation anytime as a guest and encourage you to make a further commitment to faith by becoming a member.
