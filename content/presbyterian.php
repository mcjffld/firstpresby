<h1>About the <br />
Presbyterian Church</h1>
<p>The First Presbyterian Church of Fairfield is part of the wider body of the Presbytery of Southern New England, the Synod of the Northeast, and the Presbyterian Church USA. We follow Reformed Theology which evolved during the 16th century religious movement known as the Protestant Reformation. Central to our tradition is the affirmation of the majesty, holiness, and providence of God who creates, sustains, rules, and redeems the world in the freedom of sovereign righteousness and love.
