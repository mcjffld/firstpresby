<h2>Special Programs</h2>
<p>(Contact the church office at 203-374-6176 if interested the next session) </p>
<p><strong>Christian Believer</strong><br />
    <em>&quot;Knowing God with Heart and Mind&quot;</em><br />
Christian Believer is a 30-week study of the classical doctrines of the Christian faith. These doctrines include God's Providence, Atonement, Judgment, Eternal Life and many more. Structured like the Disciple Bible program, Christian Believer participants daily read both Scripture and writings of early and modern church leaders and theologians. Once a week, individuals meet together to watch a video and discuss what they have learned. All deeply committed Christians should take Christian Believer to understand more fully what the Church has believed and taught over the centuries and to learn the concepts and images that unite us all as Christian believers. </p>
<p><strong>Alpha</strong><br />
    <em>&quot;Questions of Life&quot; - A Practical Introduction to the Christian Faith </em></p>
<p>&quot;What is the purpose of life?&quot; &quot;What happens when we die?&quot; &quot;Why did Jesus have to die?&quot; &quot;What relevance does the Bible have for our lives today?&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;Questions of Life&quot; has helped thousands of men and women around the world find answers to these questions and many more. We believe this course points the way to an authentic Christianity that is exciting and relevant to today's world. </p>
<p>A special day-retreat on a Saturday is a vital part of the Alpha experience. Childcare will be provided, if needed by any participants. </p>
<p><strong>Disciple<br />
</strong>Disciple is an approach to Bible study that emphasizes disciplined reading of and listening to Scripture, the purpose of which is to develop Biblically-nourished persons committed to living as disciples. Meeting once a week for thirty-four weeks, group participants move through the Biblical story from Creation to the New Jerusalem, giving equal time to the Old and New Testaments. Disciple is a small-group experience with 8-14 members and a facilitator who covenant together to read assigned Scripture, take notes on what they read, and bring those questions, reflections, and insights to the group meeting for discussion. </p>
